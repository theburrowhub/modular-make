# .makeignore - Exclude directories from Makefile auto-discovery
# ================================================================
# This file controls which directories containing Makefiles should be
# excluded from the main Makefile's auto-discovery and inclusion system.
#
# Format:
# - One pattern per line
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - Patterns match against directory names relative to project root
# - Use * for wildcards (shell glob patterns)
#
# Only list directories that might actually contain Makefiles
# but should not be included in the main build system.
